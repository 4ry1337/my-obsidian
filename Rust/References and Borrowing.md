A *reference* is a like a pointer in that it's an address we can follow to access the data stored at the address; that data is owned by some other variable. Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a particular type for the life of that reference.

> The opposite of referencing by using `&` is _dereferencing_, which is accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We’ll see some uses of the dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in Chapter 15.
