# Rust

Rust is a [[multi-paradigm]], [[General-purpose Programming Language|general purpose programming language]] that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without requiring the use of automated memory management techniques such as garbage collection. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation.

Common programming concepts:
- [[Variables and Mutability]]
- [[Rust - Data Types]]
- [[Rust - Functions]]
