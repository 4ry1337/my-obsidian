# Single-Source Shortest Path Problem
## Problem Definition
> Given a graph ${G}$, with vertices ${V}$, edges ${E}$ with weight function ${w(u, v) = w_{u, v}}$, and a single source vertex, ${s}$, return the shortest path from ${s}$ to other vertices in ${V}$.

## Solution
Problem can be solved using greedy technique known as [[Dijkstra's Algorithm]] or [[Bellman–Ford algorithm]]
