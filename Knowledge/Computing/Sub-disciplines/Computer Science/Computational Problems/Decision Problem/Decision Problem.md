# Decision Problem
In [[computability theory]] and [[Computational Complexity Theory|computational complexity theory]], a **decision problem** is a computational problem that can be posed as a yes–no question of the input values.

A method for solving a decision problem, given in the form of an [[Algorithm | algorithm]], is called a **decision procedure** for that problem.
