# Computational Problems
In [[Theoretical Computer Science]], a **computational problem** is a problem that may be solved by an [[Algorithm | algorithm]].

## Types of Computation Problems
- [[Decision Problem]] is a computational problem where the answer for every instance is either yes or no.
- [[Search Problem]]
- [[Counting Problem]] asks for the number of solutions to a given search problem.
- [[Optimization Problem]] asks for finding a "best possible" solution among the set of all possible solutions to a search problem.
- [[Function Problem]]  is a computational problem where a single output (of a total function) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a decision problems.
