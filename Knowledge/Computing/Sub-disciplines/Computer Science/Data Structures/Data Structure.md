In [[Computer Science]], a **data structure** is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data, i.e., it is an algebraic structure about [[Data Type#^Data | data]].

Data structures serve as the basis for [[Data Type#^AbstractDataTypes | Abstract Data Types (ADT)]].

# Classification of Data Structure
1. **Linear data structure:** Data structure in which data elements are arranged sequentially or linearly, where each element is attached to its previous and next adjacent elements, is called a linear data structure.
	1.  **Static Data Structure:** Static data structure has a fixed memory size.
		- [[Array]]
	2. **Dynamic Data Structure:** In dynamic data structure, the size is not fixed.
		- [[Queue]]
		- [[Stack]]
		- [[Linked List]]
2. **Non-linear data structure:** Data structures where data elements are not placed sequentially or linearly are called non-linear data structures.
