# Pseudocode
In [[Computer Science]], **pseudocode** is a plain language description of the steps in an [[Algorithm | algorithm]] or another system. Pseudocode often uses structural conventions of a normal [[Programming Language]], but is intended for human reading rather than machine reading. It typically omits details that are essential for machine understanding of the algorithm, such as variable declarations and language-specific code.

## Application 
Textbooks and scientific publications related to [[Computer Science]] and numerical computation often use pseudocode in description of algorithms, so that all programmers can understand them, even if they do not all know the same programming languages.

## Mathematical style pseudocode
In numerical computation, **pseudocode** often consists of [[mathematical notation]], typically from set and matrix theory, mixed with the control structures of a conventional [[Programming Language]], and perhaps also natural language descriptions.
