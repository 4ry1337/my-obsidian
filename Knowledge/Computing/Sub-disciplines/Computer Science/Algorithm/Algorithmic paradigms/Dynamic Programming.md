# Dynamic Programming
**Dynamic Programming** (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an [[Optimization Problem | optimization problems]] by breaking it down into simpler subproblems in a [[recursive]] manner and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.

## Characteristics of Dynamic Programming
### Overlapping Subproblems

^OverlappingSubproblems

Subproblems are smaller versions of the original problem. Any problem has overlapping sub-problems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblem multiple times.
### Optimal Substructure Property

^OptimalSubstructure

Optimal substructure means that the solution to a given optimization problem can be obtained by the combination of optimal solutions to its sub-problems. Such optimal substructures are usually described by means of [[recursion]]
