# Searching Algorithms
Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored. Based on the type of search operation, these algorithms are generally classified into two categories:

1.  **Sequential Search**: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked.
2.  **Interval Search**: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. These type of searching algorithms are much more efficient than [[Linear Search]] as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half.

## Common Searching Algorithms :
1. [[Linear Search]]
2. [[Binary Search]]
3. [[Insertion search]]
4. [[Jump Search]]
5. [[Interpolation Search]]
6. [[Exponential Search]]
7. [[Sublist Search (Search a linked list in another list)]]
8. [[Fibonacci Search]]
9. [[The Ubiquitous Binary Search]]
10. [[Recursive program to linearly search an element in a given array]]
11. [[Recursive function to do substring search]]
12. [[Unbounded Binary Search Example (Find the point where a monotonically increasing function becomes positive first time)]]
