# Algorithm
In [[Mathematics]] and [[Computer Science]], an **algorithm** is a finite sequence of rigorous instructions, typically used to solve a class of specific problems to perform a computation.

Algorithms can be expressed in many kinds of notation, including natural languages, [[Pseudocode | pseudocode]], [[flowcharts]], [[drakon-charts]], [[programming languages]] or control tables (processed by [[interpreters]]).

# Classification
There are various ways to classify algorithms, each with its own merits.

## By implementation
One way to classify algorithms is by implementation means.
- **Recursive** or **Iterative**
- **Logical** or **Procedural**
- **Serial** or **Parallel**
- **Deterministic** or **Non-deterministic**

## By design paradigm

Another way of classifying algorithms is by their design methodology or paradigm. There is a certain number of paradigms, each different from the other. Furthermore, each of these categories includes many different types of algorithms.
Some common paradigms are:
- **[[Brute-Force Search]]**
- **[[Divide and Conquer]]**
- **[[Backtracking]]**
- **[[Branch and Bound]]**
- **Randomized Algorithm**
- **Reduction** also called **transform and conquer**

### Optimization problems
For **optimization problems** there is a more specific classification of algorithms; an algorithm for such problems may fall into one or more of the general categories described above as well as into one of the following:
- **Linear programming**
- **[[Dynamic Programming]]**
- **[[Greedy Algorithm]]**

## By complexity
An algorithms are judged on the basis of two parameters for an input of size n :
- **[[Time Complexity]]:** Time taken by the algorithm to solve the problem. It is measured by calculating the iteration of loops, number of comparisons etc.
- +**Space Complexity:** Space taken by the algorithm to solve the problem. It includes space used by necessary input variables and any extra space (excluding the space taken by inputs) that is used by the algorithm. This extra space is known as Auxiliary Space.
