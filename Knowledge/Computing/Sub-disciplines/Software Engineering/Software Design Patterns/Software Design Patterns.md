In [[Software Engineering]], a **software design pattern** is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in [[software design]]. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. Rather, it is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Design patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system.

# Classification
Design patterns had originally been categorized into 3 sub-classifications based on what kind of problem they solve.
- [[Creational Patterns]] provide the capability to create objects based on a required criterion and in a controlled way.
- [[Structural Patterns]] are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality. 
- [[Behavioral Patterns]] are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realizing these patterns.
