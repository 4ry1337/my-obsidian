# Database Schema
A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire [[Database | database]]. It defines how the [[Data Type | data]] is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to be applied on the data.

 Database schema can be divided broadly into two categories −
- **Physical Database Schema** − This schema pertains to the actual storage of data and its form of storage like files, indices, etc. It defines how the data will be stored in a secondary storage.
  
- **Logical Database Schema** − This schema defines all the logical constraints that need to be applied on the data stored. It defines tables, views, and integrity constraints.
