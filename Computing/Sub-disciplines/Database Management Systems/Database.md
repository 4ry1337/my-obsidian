## Database languages
Database languages are special-purpose languages, which allow one or more of the following tasks, sometimes distinguished as sublanguages:
- [[Data Control Language]] (DCL) – controls access to data;
- [[Data Definition Language]] (DDL) – defines data types such as creating, altering, or dropping tables and the relationships among them;
- [[Data Manipulation Language]] (DML) – performs tasks such as inserting, updating, or deleting data occurrences;
- [[Data Query Language]] (DQL) – allows searching for information and computing derived information.

Database languages are specific to a particular [[Data Model| data model]]. Notable examples include:
- [[Structured Query Language | SQL]] combines the roles of data definition, data manipulation, and query in a single language.
- [[OQL]] is an object model language standard (from the [[Object Data Management Group]].
- [[XQuery]] is a standard XML query language implemented by XML database systems such as MarkLogic and eXist, by relational databases with XML capability such as Oracle and Db2, and also by in-memory XML processors such as Saxon.
- [[SQL/XML]] combines XQuery with SQL.
