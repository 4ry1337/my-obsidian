# Data Type
In [[Computer Science]] and [[Computer Programming]], a **Data Type** is a collection or grouping of [[Data|data]] values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values as machine types.

# Classes of Data Types
## Primitive Data Types
Primitive Data Types are a set of basic data types from which all other data types are constructed. More generally, PDT may refer to the standard data types built into the [[Programming Language]].

- **Boolean** is typically a *logical type* that can have either the value "true" or "false".
- **Character.**
- **Floating-point numbers.**
- **Integer.**
- **Reference** (also called a pointer or handle), a small value referring to another object's address in memory, possibly a much larger one.
- **Enumerated type**, a small set of uniquely named values.

## Composite Data Types
or **compound data type** is data type which can be constructed in a program using the [[Programming Language|programming language]]'s primitive data types and other composite types. It is sometimes called a **structure** or **aggregate data type**, although the latter term may also refer to arrays, lists, etc.

- **Array.**
- **Record** also know as structure.
- **Union.**

### Abstract Data Types

^AbstractDataTypes

is a mathematical model for data types. An abstract data type is defined by its behavior from the point of view of a *user*, of the data, specifically in terms of possible values, possible operations on data of this type, and the behavior of these operations.
