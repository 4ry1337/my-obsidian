In [[Computer Science]], **data** (treated as singular, plural, or as a mass noun is any sequence of one or more symbols; **datum** is a single symbol of data. Data requires interpretation to become information. Digital data is data that is represented using the binary number system of ones (1) and zeros (0). In modern (post-1960) computer systems, all data is digital.

Data exists in three states: 
- data at rest
- data in transit
- data in use

In most cases, Data within a computer [[Parallel Computation|moves as parallel data]]. Data moving to or from a computer [[Serial Computation|moves as serial data]].

Data sourced from an analog device, such as a temperature sensor, may be converted to digital using an [[Analog-to-Digital Converter|analog-to-digital converter]].
