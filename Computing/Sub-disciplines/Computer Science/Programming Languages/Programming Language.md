# Programming Language

A **programming language** is a system of notation for writing [[Computer Software|computer programs]], which are specifications of a computation or [[Algorithm | algorithm]].

## Elements
All programming languages have some [[Language Primitives|primitive]] building blocks for the description of data and the processes or transformations applied to them (like the addition of two numbers or the selection of an item from a collection). These primitives are defined by syntactic and semantic rules which describe their structure and meaning respectively.

- [[Syntax]]
- [[Semantics]]
- [[Type System]]
- [[Standard Library]]

## Taxonomies
There is no overarching classification scheme for programming language. A given programming language does not usually have a single ancestor language. Languages commonly arise by the elements of several predecessor languages with new ideas in circulation at the time.

Programming languages are classified by [[Programming Paradigm|progamming paradigm]] and intended domain use, with [[General-purpose Programming Language|general-purpose programming language]] and [[Domain-specific Programming Language|domain specific programming language]]

> An assembly language is not so much a paradigm as a direct model of an underlying machine architecture.
