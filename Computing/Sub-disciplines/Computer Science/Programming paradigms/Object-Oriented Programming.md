# Object-oriented programming
**Object-oriented programming** (**OOP**) is a [[Programming Paradigm|programming paradigm]] based on the concept of [objects], which can contain [[Data |data]] and [[code]]: data in the form of [[fields]] (often known as [[attributes]] or [[properties]], and code in the form of [procedures] (often known as [methods]).

A common feature of objects is that methods are attached to them and can access and modify the object's data fields. In this brand of OOP, there is usually a special name such as `this` or `self` used to refer to the current object.
