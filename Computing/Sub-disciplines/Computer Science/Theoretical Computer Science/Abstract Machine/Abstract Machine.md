# Abstract Machine
An **abstract machine** is a [[Computer Science | computer science]] theoretical model that allows for a detailed and precise analysis of how a computer system functions.

It is analogous to a mathematical function in that it receives inputs and produces outputs based on predefined rules. Abstract machines vary from literal machines in that they are expected to perform correctly and independently of [[Computer Hardware|hardware]].

A typical abstract machine consists of a definition in terms of input, output, and the set of allowable operations used to turn the former into the latter. In the [[Theory of Computation|theory of computation]], abstract machines are often used in thought experiments regarding computability or to [[Analysis of Algorithms|analyse]] the complexity of [[Algorithm|algorithms]].

## Classification
Abstract machines are generally classified into two types depending on the number of operations they are allowed to undertake at any one time:
- [[Deterministic Algorithm|deterministic]] abstract machines is a system in which a particular beginning state or condition always yields the same outputs.
- [[Non-deterministic Algorithm|non-deterministic]] abstract machines
