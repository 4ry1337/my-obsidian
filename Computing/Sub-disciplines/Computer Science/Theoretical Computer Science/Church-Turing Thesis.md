In [[Computability Theory]], the **Church–Turing thesis** (also known as **computability thesis**, the **Turing–Church thesis**) the **Church–Turing conjecture**, **Church's thesis**, **Church's conjecture**, and **Turing's thesis**) is a thesis about the nature of computable functions. It states that a function on the natural numbers can be calculated by an effective method if and only if it is computable by a [[Turing Machine|Turing machine]].
