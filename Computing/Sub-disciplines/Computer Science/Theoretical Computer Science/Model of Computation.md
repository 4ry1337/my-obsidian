# Model of Computation
In [[Computer Science | computer science]], and more specifically in [[Computability Theory | computability theory]] and [[Computational Complexity Theory|computational complexity theory]], a **model of computation** is a model which describes ==how an output of a mathematical function is computed given an input==. A model describes how units of computations, memories, and communications are organized. The [[Computational Complexity|computational complexity]] of an [[Algorithm|algorithm]] can be measured given a model of computation. Using a model allows studying the performance of algorithms independently of the variations that are specific to particular implementations and specific technology.

## Models
Models of computation can be classified into three categories: sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models

Some of these models have deterministic and non-deterministic variants
### Deterministic and Nondeterministic Models
#### Deterministic Model
A **deterministic model of computation** is a model of computation such that the successive states of the machine and the operations to be performed are completely determined by the preceding state.

#### Non-deterministic Model
In a **non-deterministic model of computation** some choices may be done at some steps of the computation.
