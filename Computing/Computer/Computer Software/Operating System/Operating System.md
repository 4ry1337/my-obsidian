# Operating System
An **operating system** is a [[System Software|system software]] that manages [[Computer Hardware|computer hardware]] and [[Computer Software|Software]] resources, and provides common services for [[Computer Program|computer programs]].

## Types of Operating Systems
### Single-tasking and multi-tasking
A **single-tasking operating system** allows only one program to be running at a time.

A **multi-tasking operating system** allows more than one program to be running [[Concurent Computing|concurrently]]. This is achieved by time-sharing, where the available processor time is divided between multiple processes.

**Preemptive multitasking** is achieved by slices the [[Central Processing Unit(CPU)|CPU]] time and dedicates a slot to each of the program.

**Cooperative multitasking** is achieved by relying on each process to provide time to the other processes in a defined manner.

### Single- and multi-user
Single-user operating systems have no facilities to distinguish users but may allow multiple programs to run concurrently.

Multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking with facilities that identify processes and [[resources]].
