# Parameter
In computer programming, a **parameter** or a **formal argument** is a special kind of variable used in a subroutine to refer of the pieces of data provided as input to the subroutine.

These pieces of data are the values of the **arguments** (often called _actual arguments_ or _actual parameters_) with which the subroutine is going to be called/invoked.
