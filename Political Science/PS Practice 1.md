1. **What are moral foundations of Politics?**
In his groundbreaking book, “The Righteous Mind,” Professor Jonathan Haidt attempts to answer the first question by developing a framework that he calls Moral Foundations Theory (MFT). Haidt argues that humans have six moral foundations through which we view politics and policy: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression.

*What kind of government is morally legitimate?*
It is all about line, where to draw a line to say some things are wrong and some right. Of course every human, and groups are different in their believes.

These five foundations comprise the building blocks of morality, regardless of the culture.

3. **Adolf Eichman – guilty or not?**

He is guilty.
He obeyed to orders. He says like he is just wheel of the Nazi system, which was lead by Hitler.
I found one [CNN](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/opinions/adolf-eichmann-trial-anniversary-honig/index.html) article, where one of jury of trails Gabriel Bach.

Eichman says that he didn't had any motives.

4. **Controversy of Utilitarianism**

What Is Utilitarianism?

Utilitarianism would say that an action is right if it results in the happiness of the greatest number of people in a society or a group.

- A limitation of utilitarianism is that it tends to create a black-and-white construct of morality. In utilitarian ethics, there are no shades of gray—either something is wrong or it is right.
- Utilitarianism also cannot predict with certainty whether the consequences of our actions will be good or bad—the results of our actions happen in the future.
- Utilitarianism also has trouble accounting for values like justice and individual rights. For example, say a hospital has four people whose lives depend upon receiving organ transplants: a heart, lungs, a kidney, and a liver. If a healthy person wanders into the hospital, his organs could be harvested to save four lives at the expense of his one life. This would arguably produce the greatest good for the greatest number. But few would consider it an acceptable course of action, let alone an ethical one.

5. **Basic ideas of Marxism**

Marxism posits that the struggle between social classes—specifically between the bourgeoisie, or capitalists, and the proletariat, or workers—defines economic relations in a capitalist economy and will inevitably lead to revolutionary communism.

- Marx wrote that the power relationships between capitalists and workers were inherently exploitative and would inevitably create class conflict.

Both communism and socialism oppose capitalism, an economic system characterized by private ownership and a system of laws that protect the right to own or transfer private property. In a capitalist economy, private individuals and enterprises own the means of production and the right to profit from them. Communism and socialism aim to right the wrongs of capitalism’s free-market system. These include worker exploitation and inequities between rich and poor.

Not so far. Some countries, such as the former Soviet Union, China, and Cuba, have attempted to create a communist society, but they were or have been unable to entirely eliminate personal property, money, and class systems. In 2021, capitalism, in its various forms, remains the dominant economic system. Of course, some of his critiques of capitalism remain true to this day, such as the fact that corporations will acquire one another to become larger and more concentrated, that unemployment and poverty will persist, and that workers will continue to be paid less than what they might deserve.

6. **Advantages and disadvantages of capitalism**

- *Advantages*
1. Capitalism gives people an incentive to work hard
   *This is due to the fact that people are allowed to keep a high fraction of their income and can buy many things they want from it.*
2. People are allowed to accumulate wealth
3. Lower tax rates compared to other political regimes
4. Individual performance is valued
5. Capitalism encourages competition
   *While this might be rather bad for some companies since they may have to go out of business, a higher level of competition among firms is usually quite good for the general public.*
6. Efficiency of markets is maximized
7. Good environment for international investors
8. Capitalism encourages technological progress
9. Capitalism can help to increase GDP
10. Capitalism provides high levels of freedom
11. Encourages international relationships
12. Lower consumer prices
13. Better quality of products
14. Bigger variety of products

- *Disadvantages*
1. Capitalism may increase income and wealth gap
   *If people only have to pay rather low tax rates on their capital gains as well as on high incomes, chances are that highly-qualified people who come from wealthy families will have the opportunity to accumulate large amounts of wealth. On the other end of the spectrum, children from poor families will often be left behind since they will not get the opportunity and financial support for proper education from the government in a capitalist system.*
2. Capitalism leads to an excessive focus on consumption
3. May lead to more homelessness
4. May lead to insufficient welfare
5. Capitalism does not care about minimum wages**
6. Workers may get exploited
7. Especially bad for low-skilled workers
8. Capitalism may lead to private monopolies
9. Higher unemployment rates during economic downturns
10. Higher rents
11. Higher property prices
12. Capitalism can increase social tensions in our society
13. People will not get equal chances in life
14. May contribute to many environmental problems
