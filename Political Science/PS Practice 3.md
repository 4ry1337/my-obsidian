2. Waves of globalization

There have been several waves of globalization in modern history.
	1. The first wave of globalization, also known as the "first era of globalization," occurred during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This wave was characterized by the expansion of European colonial empires and the increase in international trade.
	2. The second wave of globalization, also known as the "golden age of globalization," occurred after World War II and lasted until the early 1970s. This wave was characterized by the growth of multinational corporations and the further expansion of international trade. 
	3. The third wave of globalization, also known as the "globalization of the 1980s and 1990s," was characterized by the increased role of developing countries in the global economy and the spread of free-market economic policies. 
	4. The current wave of globalization, also known as the "globalization of the 21st century," is characterized by the increasing interconnectedness of the world through the growth of the internet and the increasing importance of global supply chains. This wave has also been marked by the increasing role of emerging economies, such as China and India, in the global economy.

3. Influence of globalization on political system of Kazakhstan

Globalization has had a significant influence on the political system of Kazakhstan. As a country with a strong resource-based economy, Kazakhstan has been heavily involved in international trade and has sought to attract foreign investment. This has led to economic growth and development in the country, but has also brought about political and social changes.

One major influence of globalization on Kazakhstan's political system has been the adoption of free-market economic policies. In the 1990s, Kazakhstan implemented market-oriented reforms and opened up its economy to foreign investment, leading to increased trade and economic growth. These reforms were supported by international organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which provided financial assistance and technical support.

Globalization has also led to increased cultural exchange in Kazakhstan, as the country has become more connected to the rest of the world. This has led to the adoption of some Western cultural practices, such as the increasing popularity of fast food chains and Western-style clothing.

Overall, the influence of globalization on Kazakhstan's political system has been mixed. While it has brought about economic growth and development, it has also led to some social and cultural changes that have not been welcomed by everyone in the country.

4. The essence of international relations
   
International relations is the study of relationships between countries, including the interactions between states, international organizations, non-governmental organizations, and multinational corporations. It involves the examination of a wide range of issues, including diplomacy, international security, economic relations, international law, and globalization.

At its essence, international relations is concerned with the ways in which countries interact with one another and the various factors that influence those interactions. It seeks to understand the motivations and interests of different countries and how they pursue their goals in the international system.

International relations also involves the study of international institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, which play a central role in shaping the rules and norms that govern international relations.

Overall, the essence of international relations is the study of the complex and multifaceted relationships between countries and the various actors that operate within the international system.

5. The influence of international organizations to the solving of global problems

International organizations play a significant role in the effort to solve global problems. These organizations, which can be intergovernmental (such as the United Nations) or nongovernmental (such as Amnesty International), provide a forum for countries to come together to address issues of common concern. They can also serve as a means for countries to coordinate their efforts and work towards common goals.

Some examples of global problems that international organizations have worked to address include:

- Climate change: International organizations, such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), have played a central role in negotiating international agreements to address climate change and in coordinating efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  
- Poverty and economic development: International organizations, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, have provided financial assistance and technical support to help countries address issues of poverty and economic development.  
- Armed conflict and peacekeeping: International organizations, such as the United Nations, have worked to prevent and resolve armed conflicts and have deployed peacekeeping forces to conflict-affected regions.  
- Health: International organizations, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), have played a central role in efforts to address global health challenges, such as the Ebola and COVID-19 pandemics.

Overall, international organizations have the potential to make a significant contribution to the solving of global problems, but their effectiveness can depend on the level of cooperation and support they receive from member states

6. Balance of power

The balance of power in globalization refers to the distribution of economic and political power among countries in the global system. In a globalized world, the balance of power can be influenced by a variety of factors, including the size and strength of a country's economy, its military capabilities, and its political influence.

In recent years, there has been a shift in the balance of power in globalization as some emerging economies, such as China and India, have become more influential on the global stage. This has led to a more multipolar world, in which a small number of countries wield significant influence, rather than a unipolar world in which a single country, such as the United States, holds a dominant position.

The balance of power in globalization can have important implications for international relations, as countries with more economic and political power may be able to shape the rules and norms of the global system to their advantage. It can also influence the distribution of wealth and resources among countries, as those with more power may be able to secure a larger share of the benefits of globalization.

The balance of power refers to the distribution of power among different actors in a system. In international relations, the balance of power refers to the distribution of power among countries. A balance of power can be understood in terms of military, economic, and political capabilities.

The balance of power is a central concept in international relations theory, and various theories seek to explain how the balance of power among countries evolves over time. Some theories, such as realism, argue that the balance of power is a key factor in shaping international relations and that states will seek to maintain a balance of power in order to protect their own interests. Other theories, such as liberalism, argue that international institutions and norms can play a role in shaping the balance of power and in reducing the likelihood of conflict.

The balance of power can also be understood in terms of the distribution of power within a country, such as the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. In this context, the balance of power refers to the distribution of power among different branches or levels of government and the ways in which they check and balance each other's power.
