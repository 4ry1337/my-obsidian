4. Political Regimes: democracy, authoritarian, totalitarian regimes (comparative analysis in table and charts)

- *Democracy* refers to political system in which citizens govern themselves either directly or indirectly.
- *Authoritarianism* refers to political systems in which an individual or a group of individuals holds power, restricts or prohibits popular participation in governance, and represses dissent.
- *Totalitarianism* refers to political systems that include all the features of authoritarianism but are even more repressive as they try to regulate and control all aspects of citizens’ lives and fortunes.

5. Basic political ideologies – liberalism, conservatism, socialism, feminism, etc.

*Liberalism* - rejects what is viewed as traditional social ideas and emphasises the importance of personal freedom, and the power of individual and collective rationality. This emphasis on individual freedom and rationality has contributed to its sustained embrace as an ideology.
*Conservatism* - characterised by its reluctance to or suspicion of change. Conservatives call to maintain tradition, underpinned by a belief in human imperfection and attempts to uphold what they view as the organic structure of society.
*Socialism* - aims to establish a human alternative to capitalism and believes in the concepts of collectivism and social equality as the foundation for a better society. Socialist ideologies also seek to abolish class divisions.
*Anarchism* - a political ideology that places the rejection of the state at its epicentre. Anarchism rejects all forms of coercive authority and hierarchy in favour of the organisation of society based on cooperation and voluntary participation. While most ideologies are concerned with how to manage authority and rule in society, anarchism is unique in that it rejects the presence of both authority and rule.
*Nationalism* - an ideology based on the concept that a person’s loyalty and devotion to the nation-state are more important than any individual or group interest.
*Feminism* - a political term that emerged in the 1900s. It is an ideology that fundamentally seeks to establish the social, economic, and political equality of the sexes.
